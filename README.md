# 2048
beta version of a 2048 I've created with angularJS in one night. There's still some known issues that'll work on when I'll have some free time.


Edit : 2nd day of development.
	I've added a score functionnality and it's now full MEAN stack.
	Highest 10 scores are stored on mongoDB and displayed to the used playing.


Upcoming updates :
	Make the highscore table 100% real-time, it's now differed and that can cause some issues/bugs if more than 1 person is
	hitting the highest score at the same time.
